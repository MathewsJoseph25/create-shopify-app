      We have shop data in our database, but if a customer uninstalls and try to reinstall the app quickly, 
      then, we may not have got the uninstall webhook yet and so, we may think that the shop is installed,
      but, it isn't. To solve this problem, we'll request the shop info from shopify using the auth token that 
      we have on our database. So, if the shop has been uninstalled, we'll not get the shop data and so, we can confirm
      in that case that our app isn't installed and so, we can redirect to the install url. 
      
      When the app is installed, this auth phase only happens on the first app load and all subsequest loads doesn't have
      to go through this store lookup process again and so, it won't add latency to future calls to our server from the store.
